## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a banking data ecosystem where customer, account, and transaction data is continuously captured, processed, and transformed into analytics-ready datasets.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how raw operational data can be moved through a reliable data pipeline and shaped into meaningful business insights. The pipeline focuses on handling changing data, preserving raw records, building clean analytical models, and supporting dashboard-based reporting for areas such as customer activity, account behaviour, transaction trends, and data quality.

Rather than being a simple data loading exercise, this project is designed to reflect the kind of workflow used in real banking analytics environments, where data needs to be trustworthy, well-structured, and easy to consume for reporting and decision-making.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**ERD diagram**:
![alt text](</public/images/Banking ERD.png>)



**Pipeline Flow:**
1. **Data Generator** → Simulates banking transactions, accounts & customers (via Faker).  
2. **Kafka + Debezium** → Streams change data (CDC) into MinIO (S3-compatible storage).  
3. **Airflow** → Orchestrates data ingestion & snapshots into Snowflake.  
4. **Snowflake** → Cloud Data Warehouse (Bronze → Silver → Gold).  
5. **DBT** → Applies transformations, builds marts & snapshots (SCD Type-2).  
6. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** → Automated tests, build & deployment.

## ⚡ Tech Stack
- **Snowflake** → Cloud Data Warehouse  
- **DBT** → Transformations, testing, snapshots (SCD Type-2)  
- **Apache Airflow** → Orchestration & DAG scheduling  
- **Apache Kafka + Debezium** → Real-time streaming & CDC  
- **MinIO** → S3-compatible object storage  
- **Postgres** → Source OLTP system  
- **Python (Faker)** → Data simulation  
- **Docker & docker-compose** → Containerized setup  
- **Git & GitHub Actions** → CI/CD workflows  

---

## ✅ Key Features
- **PostgreSQL OLTP**: Source relational database with ACID guarantees (customers, accounts, transactions)  
- **Simulated banking system**: customers, accounts, and transactions  
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** via Kafka + Debezium (capturing Postgres WAL)  
- **Raw → Staging → Fact/Dimension** models in DBT  
- **Snapshots for history tracking** (slowly changing dimensions)  
- **Automated pipeline orchestration** using Airflow  
- **CI/CD pipeline** with dbt tests + GitHub Actions

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation  

### **1. Data Simulation**  
- Generated synthetic banking data (**customers, accounts, transactions**) using **Faker**.  
- Inserted data into **PostgreSQL (OLTP)** so the system behaves like a real transactional database (**ACID, constraints**).  
- Controlled generation via `config.yaml`.  

---

### **2. Kafka + Debezium CDC**  
- Set up **Kafka Connect & Debezium** to capture changes from **Postgres**.  
- Streamed **CDC events** into **MinIO**.  

---

### **3. Airflow Orchestration**  
- Built DAGs to:  
  - Ingest **MinIO data → Snowflake (Bronze)**.  
  - Schedule **snapshots & incremental loads**.  

---

### **4. Snowflake Warehouse**  
- Organized into **Bronze → Silver → Gold layers**.  
- Created **staging schemas** for ingestion.  

---

### **5. DBT Transformations**  
- **Staging models** → cleaned source data.  
- **Dimension & fact models** → built marts.  
- **Snapshots** → tracked history of accounts & customers.  

---

### **6. CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
- **ci.yml** → Lint, dbt compile, run tests.  
- **cd.yml** → Deploy DAGs & dbt models on merge.  

---

## 📊 Final Deliverables  
- **Automated CDC pipeline** from Postgres → Snowflake  
- **DBT models** (facts, dimensions, snapshots)  
- **Orchestrated DAGs in Airflow**  
- **Synthetic banking dataset** for demos  
- **CI/CD workflows** ensuring reliability
